Night mix with day, a shadow made
Where to start, to get afar
Confronted by a solemn wall, someone who won't call
Greeted by a pasture, with welcoming embrace
Thrown down by a menace 
Forcing solitude, until a better time draws
But walls are meant to be climbed
Diving into the green sea, you swim free
But you shy away from its shine
But you stand up and avoid
Even mean won't make it move, so you re-choose
But you lit this pasture with your burning hatred
Yet you return the pain
But you stand up and pacify
Perhaps a chance to redeem
Perhaps a chance to redeem
Perhaps a chance to redeem
Perhaps a chance to redeem
Perhaps a chance to redeem
Perhaps a chance to redeem
Yet, only your blood spilled, hoping to heal
Yet, only blood spilled, never can heal
Reconcile what was once fire
Questioned by a muddied lake
Without answer you stray from the waterbed
So you sit on the coast
As your answer, you dive in
A muddied vision, unclear to harm
A hope that ember will keep you warm
But an ember will burn you before it gives you warmth
Seperating from the world
An indulgence to cover your sin
An offer declined, a future ruined
Manipulate the manipulative
Seperating from the world
Exchanging an offering of friendship
Exchanging an offering for friendship
Fruitless efforts made
Some easily forgive
Some feel the hurt
Some don't mind
The weather spur you to choose one who care
They test your will for compassion
Envy eyes glare at your gold
Compassionate hearts offer themselves
And measure the circle that grows
Envy eyes glare at your gold
Finding reprieve in the balance
Others value your boldness
No need for trouble
Halos make themselves seen
Your heart grows fond of the pasture
Time to reconsider
Time to reconsider
A fight is what you need
Fleeing rather than facing your fears
But sometimes edges are met
So you smooth it out
Helpless, hoping for miracles
Even efforts go to naught when opportunity is null
Into that once perfect shape
prefering a dual strategy
Everything is one sided
A liar amongst success
A deadend
but miracles comes alive
Everything is one sided
Sin doesn't go without punish.
Karma hits hard
Even if only temporarily
Everything is one sided
Wanting better than average
Satisfied with your efforts
The world against you
prefering belligerence
Nothing bothers you
It grows and envelops
Festivities ensue a frightful storm
As you step into a new realm
Where sacrifices fill the void
Overwhelmed by indecisiveness
Preferring one over the other
Preferring one over the other, eventually an end, your circle, tint Blue
Eventually an end, your circle, tint Blue
Eventually an end, your circle, tint Pink
Eventually an end, your circle, forever alone
Eventually an end, your circle, tint Pink
Bland, trite, so you leave
Fire always so belligerent
Preferring one over the other, eventually an end, your circle, tint Red
Preferring one over the other, eventually an end, your circle, tint Orange
Indecisiveness strikes, eventually an end, your circle, forever alone
Which path to take
Eventually an end, your circle, tint Red
Not yes, not no, but something in between
To retink your options
Eventually an end, your circle, tint Red
To retink your options
Others aim to entertain
Eventually an end, your circle, tint Green
While you aim to hurt
To rethink once again
Eventually an end, your circle tint Green and Orange
The once frozen wall decides to call
But you don’t reply, eventually an end, your circle, forever alone
You go towards with curious mind
Hoping to burgeon your circle
A dark path chosen, eventually an end, your circle, tint Black
A dark path avoided, eventually an end, your circle forever alone
Troublesome fear stirs
But your boldness wins, eventually an end, your circle, tint Blue
Cowardly flee, eventually an end, your circle, forever alone
Circle comes forth, conquering fear
Confronted with a dark path
You avoid and reconsider
You go down, eventually an end, your circle, tint Black
revenge taken, for your malice
yet an unexpected twist
A light reaching out
a chance to reconcile
but a chance amiss
eventually an end, your circle, tint Orange
Searching for that missing curve
but nothing is easy
eventually an end, your circle, forever alone
eventually an end, your circle, tint Green
eventually an end, your circle, tint Blue
eventually an end, your circle, forever alone
